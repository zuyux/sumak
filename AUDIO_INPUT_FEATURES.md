Perfect! 🎵 I've successfully implemented audio input functionality for the visualizer! Here's what I've added:

## ✨ **New Audio Input Features**

### 🎤 **Audio Input Button** (`AudioInputButton.tsx`)
- **Microphone Input**: Capture audio from your microphone
- **System Audio**: Capture audio playing on your computer (screen audio)
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows connection status with animated indicators
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for permissions/setup issues

### 🔊 **Audio Input Hook** (`useAudioInput.ts`)
- **Cross-browser Support**: Works with all modern browsers
- **Real-time Processing**: Provides frequency data and audio levels
- **Permission Management**: Handles microphone and screen capture permissions
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Properly disconnects and cleans up resources

### 🌟 **Enhanced Visualizer** (`OrbVisualizer.tsx`)
- **External Audio Support**: Can now use external audio input instead of just music files
- **Seamless Switching**: Automatically switches between music player and external audio
- **Real-time Visualization**: Both the 3D orb and circular visualizer respond to external audio

### 📍 **Button Placement**
- Located in the **top-right corner** of the screen
- Easy access without interfering with other UI elements
- Shows connection status and input type

## 🎮 **How to Use**

1. **Click the "Connect Audio" button** in the top-right corner
2. **Choose your input source**:
   - **Microphone Input**: Captures audio from your mic (great for live music, voice, ambient sound)
   - **System Audio**: Captures audio from your computer (perfect for any music/videos playing)
3. **Grant permissions** when your browser asks
4. **Watch the visualizer react** to your audio input in real-time!

## 🔧 **Technical Features**

- **Web Audio API**: Uses modern browser audio processing
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes audio at 60fps for smooth visualization
- **Audio Level Detection**: Provides both frequency data and overall volume levels
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to music player audio when external input disconnects
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed for better development experience

## 💡 **Use Cases**

- **Live Music Visualization**: Connect a microphone to visualize live performances
- **System Audio Visualization**: Visualize any audio playing on your computer
- **Interactive Experiences**: Create responsive visual experiences with ambient sound
- **DJ/Performance Tool**: Use for live visual performances with real-time audio

The visualizer now works with **any audio source** - whether it's music files from the app or live audio from your microphone/system! 🎊
